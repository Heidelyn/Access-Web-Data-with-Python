# Access-Web-Data-with-Python
In this repository you can find some python programs, where I treated the Internet as a source of data. 
This programs scraped, parsed, and read web data as well as accessed data using web APIs.  
I worked with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python.
These were exercises from the Course "Using Python to Access Web Data", Universidad de Michigan-Coursera.
